#### 输入格式

  
The first line contains two numbers N and Q. 1 ≤ N,Q ≤ 100000.  
The second line contains N numbers, the initial values of A1, A2, ... , AN. -1000000000 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000000000.  
Each of the next Q lines represents an operation.  
"C a b c" means adding c to each of Aa, Aa+1, ... , Ab. -10000 ≤ c ≤ 10000.  
"Q a b" means querying the sum of Aa, Aa+1, ... , Ab.
