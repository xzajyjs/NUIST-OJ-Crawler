#### 题目描述

  
Farmer John's N (1 <= N <= 100,000) cows are lined up in a row and  
numbered 1..N. The cows are conducting another one of their strange  
protests, so each cow i is holding up a sign with an integer A\_i  
(-10,000 <= A\_i <= 10,000).  
  
FJ knows the mob of cows will behave if they are properly grouped  
and thus would like to arrange the cows into one or more contiguous  
groups so that every cow is in exactly one group and that every  
group has a nonnegative sum.  
  
Help him count the number of ways he can do this, modulo 1,000,000,009.  
  
By way of example, if N = 4 and the cows' signs are 2, 3, -3, and  
1, then the following are the only four valid ways of arranging the  
cows:  
  
(2 3 -3 1)  
(2 3 -3) (1)  
(2) (3 -3 1)  
(2) (3 -3) (1)  
  
Note that this example demonstrates the rule for counting different  
orders of the arrangements.  
  
给出n个数，问有几种划分方案（不能改变数的位置），使得每组中数的和大于等于0。输出方案数除以 1000000009的余数。
