### [2018 江苏省大学生程序设计大赛]
### B. Higher h-index
>
#### ** Problem **
> The h-index of an author is the largest h where he has at least h papers with citations not less than h.

> Bobo has no papers and he is going to publish some subsequently. If he works on a paper for x hours, the paper will get (a·x) citations, where a is a known constant. It’s clear that x should be a positive integer. There is also a trick – one can cite his own papers published earlier.

> Given Bobo has n working hours, ﬁnd the maximum h-index of him.

#### ** Input **
> The input consists of several test cases and is terminated by end-of-ﬁle.

> Each test case contains two integers n and a.

#### ** Output **
> For each test case, print an integer which denotes the maximum h-index.

#### ** Constraint **
> • 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10⁹

> • 0 ≤ a ≤ n

> • The number of test cases does not exceed 10⁴.

#### ** Sample Input **
> 3 0

> 3 1

> 1000000000 1000000000

#### ** Sample Output **
> 1

> 2

> 1000000000

#### ** Note **
> For the ﬁrst sample, Bobo can work 3 papers for 1 hour each. With the trick mentioned, he will get papers with citations 2,1,0. Thus, his h-index is 1.

> For the second sample, Bobo can work 2 papers for 1 and 2 hours respectively. He will get papers with citations 1 + 1, 2 + 0. Thus, his h-index is 2.
