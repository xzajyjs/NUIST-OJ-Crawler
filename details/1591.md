#### 题目描述

Farmer John has purchased N (5 <= N <= 250) fence posts in order to build a very nice-looking fence. Everyone knows the best fences are convex polygons where fence posts form vertices of a polygon. The pasture is represented as a rectilinear grid; fencepost i is at integer coordinates (x\_i, y\_i) (1 <= x\_i <= 1,000; 1 <= y\_i <= 1000). Given the locations of N fence posts (which, intriguingly, feature no set of three points which are collinear), what is the largest number of fence posts FJ can use to create a fence that is convex? For test cases worth 45% of the points for this problem, N <= 65. Farmer John

有n(5≤n≤250)个栅栏点，他需要围成一个栅栏圈，这个圈是一个凸包并且凸包上的点最多....
