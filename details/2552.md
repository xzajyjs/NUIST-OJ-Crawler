#### 题目描述

Given an m\*n grid, you're required to fill it with the numbers from 1 to m\*n but the following rules should be satisfied:

1\. each number in grid is larger than its above;  
2\. each number in grid is larger than its left.  

Now, I wonder how many distinct solutions I could make on a grid.

For example. Consider such a 2\*3 grid, we have the following solutions:

```
 123  124  134  135  125
		456  356  256  246  346 
```

Thus, the sum is 5.
