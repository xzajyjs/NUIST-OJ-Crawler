#### 题目描述

Bessie the cow is a huge fan of card games, which is quite surprising, given her lack of opposable thumbs. Unfortunately, none of the other cows in the herd are good opponents. They are so bad, in fact, that they always play in a completely predictable fashion! Nonetheless, it can still be a challenge for Bessie to figure out how to win.  
Bessie and her friend Elsie are currently playing a simple card game where they take a deck of 2N cards, conveniently numbered 1…2N, and divide them into N cards for Bessie and N cards for Elsie. The two then play N rounds, where in each round Bessie and Elsie both play a single card, and the player with the highest card earns a point.  
Given that Bessie can predict the order in which Elsie will play her cards, please determine the maximum number of points Bessie can win.

奶牛Bessie和Elsie在玩一种卡牌游戏。一共有2N张卡牌，点数分别为1到2N，每头牛都会分到N张卡牌。

游戏一共分为N轮，因为Bessie太聪明了，她甚至可以预测出每回合Elsie会出什么牌。

每轮游戏里，两头牛分别出一张牌，点数大者获胜。

Bessie现在想知道，自己最多能获胜多少轮？
