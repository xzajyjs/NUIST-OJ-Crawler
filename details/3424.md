#### 题目描述

Byteasar lives in Byteburg, a city famous for its milk bars on every corner. One day Byteasar came up with an idea of a "milk multidrink": he wants to visit each milk bar for a drink exactly once. Ideally, Byteasar would like to come up with a route such that the next bar is always no further than two blocks (precisely: intersections) away from the previous one.

The intersections in Byteburg are numbered from1toN, and all the streets are bidirectional. Between each pair of intersections there is a unique direct route, ie, one that does not visit any intersection twice. Byteasar begins at the intersection no.1and finishes at the intersection no.N.

Your task is to find any route that satisfies Byteasar's requirements if such a route exists.

#### 输入格式

In the first line of the standard input there is a single integerN(2<=N<=500000), denoting the number of intersections in Byteburg. Each of the followingN-1lines holds a pair of distinct integersAiandBi(1<=Ai,Bi<=N) separated by a single space, that represent the street linking the intersections no.AiandBi.

#### 输出格式

If there is no route satisfying Byteasar's requirements, your program should print a single word "BRAK" (Polish for_none_), without the quotation marks to the standard output. Otherwise, your program should printNlines to the standard output, the i-th of which should contain the number of thei-th intersection on an arbitrary route satisfying Byteasar's requirements. Obviously, in that case the first line should hold the number1, and theN-th line - numberN.
