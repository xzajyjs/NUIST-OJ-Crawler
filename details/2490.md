#### 题目描述

Some brave warriors come to a lost village. They are very lucky and find a lot  
of treasures and a big treasure chest, but with angry zombies.  
The warriors are so brave that they decide to defeat the zombies and then  
bring all the treasures back. A brutal long-drawn-out battle lasts from morning to  
night and the warriors find the zombies are undead and invincible.  
Of course, the treasures should not be left here. Unfortunately, the warriors  
cannot carry all the treasures by  the treasure chest due to the  limitation of  the  
capacity of the chest. Indeed, there are only two types of treasures: emerald and  
sapphire.  All  of  the emeralds  are equal in size and value, and with infinite  
quantities. So are sapphires.  
Being the priest of the warriors with the magic artifact: computer, and given  
the size of the chest, the value and size of each types of gem, you should compute  
the maximum value of treasures our warriors could bring back.
