#### 题目描述

Farmer John has N cows that need to be milked (1 <= N <= 10,000), each of which takes only one unit of time to milk. Being impatient animals, some cows will refuse to be milked if Farmer John waits too long to milk them. More specifically, cow i produces g\_i gallons of milk (1 <= g\_i <= 1000), but only if she is milked before a deadline at time d\_i (1 <= d\_i <= 10,000). Time starts at t=0, so at most x total cows can be milked prior to a deadline at time t=x. Please help Farmer John determine the maximum amount of milk that he can obtain if he milks the cows optimally.
