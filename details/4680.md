#### 题目描述

As we know, Rikka is poor at math. At the test, Rikka finds that she cannot even do a single problem. There is one of the insane problems:

Given an integer K, she needs to come up with an n×n 01 matrix A and an integer m which meet B1,n=K, where B=Am.

It is too difficult for Rikka. Can you help her?
