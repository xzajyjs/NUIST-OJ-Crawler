#### 题目描述

You are given a tree (an acyclic undirected connected graph) with _n_ nodes. The tree nodes are numbered from 1 to _n_.

Each node has a color, white or black. All the nodes are black initially.

We will ask you to perfrom some instructions of the following form:

*   0 _u_ : ask for how many nodes are connected to _u_, two nodes are connected iff all the node on the path from _u_ to _v_ (inclusive _u_ and _v_) have a same color.
*   1 _u_ : toggle the color of _u_(that is, from black to white, or from white to black).

#### 输入格式

The first line contains a number _n_ denoted how many nodes in the tree(1 ≤ _n_ ≤ 105). The next _n_ - 1 lines, each line has two numbers (_u_,  _v_) describe a edge of the tree(1 ≤ _u_,  _v_ ≤ _n_). The next line contains a number _m_ denoted how many operations we are going to process(1 ≤ _m_ ≤ 105). The next _m_ lines, each line describe a operation (_t_,  _u_) as we mentioned above(0 ≤ _t_ ≤ 1, 1 ≤ _u_ ≤ _n_).
